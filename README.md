Project Idea: 

We want to make an app in iOS 12, which will help our community more likely the working class people who want to go to the Middle East to do jobs. We know that there are so many people from our country every day, leaving the country to earn their livelihood or for a better life they are leaving the country. But in the process, sometimes they face a lot of difficulties and problems. They got cheated by some people who process their visa. The people who supply the visa or do the processing to help them get the visa. The visa providers tell them the wrong things about their visa type. Sometimes they even lie about the job they will be doing abroad. The cheater also lies about their salary they will get for the work they will do. They sell the visa for a higher price and who is buying the visa get cheated. We want to solve this problem. Our app will scan the visa first and then it will tell them about the visa category and types of work they can do with the respective type of visa and maybe the salary also which they will be getting after doing their job there. In this way, the working class people most likely who are not aware of Arabic language and visa type can be saved from getting cheated by some cheaters who are using poor peoples trust to make money in a bad way.



Features:


Scan the visa
No extra camera will necessary for the scanning 
The app will use the built-in camera from the phone
The app will ask if it can store the papers information for better support in the future.
Translate the language in English from the Arabic Language
Privacy Features which will allow the user to keep their data private
It will tell them about the work they will be able to do abroad
It will also tell them about overtime opportunities 
It can provide information about the time they can stay there
It may be able to guess the salary or shows the wage if it is available in the visa or the processing papers





Technology: 

We will be using the latest version of swift 4 for making the iOS App. Swift 4 is fast and reliable for developing new apps for iOS development Apple is developing it for the last few years for a better and quicker app experience, and they are introducing some new features in every year which is making the language more usable. We know that for database for apps, one of the most reliable providers is Firestore. Firestore is much easier and faster it is expensive compared to the other databases, but as this app is for working class people, we will make less profit from the app because the money we can earn by showing them ad on the app we will invest in the database management or the development of the app. We will be using google translator API to translate Arabic to English or Bengali to translate the Arabic language.
To do the work, maybe we will need to scan the visa, and for studying the permit, we will use the phone's camera.
We will use apple Core ML technology to teach the app to collect the keyword from the visa and show information from the visa.
If we need to use augmented reality to scan the visa from the passport or the papers. We can use apples AR kit 2.0


Monetization:

Monetization is one of the most important things to plan before making an app. Because maintaining an app is not cheap. Even the database cost a considerable amount of money. The app will be free to download from the App Store, but We will show advertisements in the app in a specific period and the bottom space of the screen of the app will show advertisement. We are currently planning to use Google ad sense, for now, to display advertisements since it has become trendy and most of the companies which are showing their publication in the app are mainly using google for marketing their products.
